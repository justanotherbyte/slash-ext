# slash-ext

Yet another slash command lib made for discord.py, except this one intergrates will intergrate with `discord.ext`, thus making it a lot easier to use. Some resources are provided too, such as the `INTERACTION_CREATE` socket response. This is provided in the `debug.json` file. I do not mind sharing this token as its invalid.
